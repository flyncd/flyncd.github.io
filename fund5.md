# Deliverables for Fund 5

## Schema Creation

Extend the SolveMathAction (https://schema.org/SolveMathAction) and MathSolver ( https://schema.org/MathSolver ) to create a schema for registration and assessment of automated services

### Registration Schema

```Demo```

### Submission Schema

```Demo```

## Simulation

Create a simulated demo of a "Credit Risk" model which is capable of assessing the likelihood that an entity (such as an Atala Prism Decentralised Identity) will default in the next 3 months

```Demo```


## Pubication to Blockchain

Produce a script to periodically collate and publish metrics. The summary of which is published as a blockchain transaction

```Demo```


## Query Cardano Metadata

Provide a tool which can query and aggregate metadata stored on the Cardano blockchain that targets a specific metric (eg Gini or KS for the qCreditScore model). The tool should be portable enough so that any user capable of querying the underlying Cardano blockchain metadata can produce reports.

```Demo```

## Conclusion and Findings

Add a supplementary section to project website detailing lessons learnt, unsolved questions and future work

```Demo```
